This is a fix for the Raven Addon in The Burning Crusade Anniversary.

I am not an addon/LUA developer and used AI to diagnose and fix errors.

To get it working, temporary weapon buff tracking was disabled. This means Raven can no longer track things like Windfury, Rogue Poisons, Mana Oils, etc.

This will not be maintained in the future and only exists as a temporary fix until the author updates it.
